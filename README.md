# CrashEarlyCrashOften

## Basics

### What does this mod do?
This mod makes the game crash with a useful crash report when it detects
something has gone wrong, instead of crashing later with a useless crash
report.

### How do I use this mod?
You need Minecraft Forge installed first. Once that's done, just drop
crashearlycrashoften-*version*.jar in your Minecraft instance's mods/
directory.

## Development

You need a JDK installed first. Start a command prompt or terminal in the

will be saved to build/libs/crashearlycrashoften-*version*.jar.
